There are two words, $w1$ and $w2$ figure out the minimum number of operations required to convert $w1$ to $w2$. You can do 3 operations on a word:
1) Insert a character
2) Delete a character
3) Replace a character

Ex.
$w1$ = "almost"
$w2$ = "algomonster"

Output = 5

almost -> algmost
algmost -> algomost
algomost -> algomonst
algomonst -> algomonste
algomonste -> algomonster

Solution:
