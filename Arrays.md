Arrays are a basic data structure consisting of a memory address and some stored value, are are the foundation of many complex data structures such as stacks, queues and heaps.

#### Forward / Backward Traversal
Ocasionally a problem is simplified by independently traversing the array from left->right and right->left, generally because there is a relation between some index $i$ in the array and previous elements $j$ where $j < i$ or future elements $k$ where $k > i$.
